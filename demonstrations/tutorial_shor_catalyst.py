As quantum computing hardware continues to scale up, the way we write and
interact with quantum software is evolving. Writing and optimizing quantum
circuits by hand for algorithms with hundreds or thousands of qubits is
unsustainable, even for the most seasoned quantum programmers. To develop
large-scale algorithms, we need frameworks that allow us to sit at a comfortable
level of abstraction, and tools we can trust to do the heavy lifting under the
hood. The integration of version 0.34 of PennyLane with `Catalyst
<https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/latest/index.html>`_ represents
a positive step in this direction. In this demonstration we will show how
Catalyst enables an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm that is
just-in-time compiled from end-to-end, classical control structure and all.

Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms
-----------------------------------

Shor's algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The past few years stimulated a lot of discussion about "hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms". For a time, this was taken to be synonymous with
variational algorithms. However, integration with a classical co-processor is a
necessary component of every quantum algorithm, even ones like Shor's algorithm,
which is often considered quintessentially quantum.

Shor's factoring algorithm leverages an exponential speedup afforded by the
quantum order-finding routine. But, take a closer look at the algorithmic
structure of Shor's algorithm in the pseudocode below.

```python
def shors_algorithm(N):
INSERT PSEUDOCODE HERE
```

If you didn't know this was Shor's algorithm, would you even realize it was
quantum? The classical and quantum parts are closely intertwined, as output
sampled after running a quantum subroutine is post-processed by classical
number-theory functions.

Compiling classical and quantum code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a more traditional quantum programming setting, the `run_qpe` subroutine is
like a quantum black box. It is written separately, optimized separately (using
your favourite quantum circuit optimization tricks), and simply plugged into the
classical control flow as needed.

More importantly, though, consider that in Shor's algorithm, the structure of
this black box is not fixed. It depends on a randomly-chosen integer, :math:`a`.
All the modular exponentiation circuits using in the QPE algorithm under the hood
depend directly on this :math:`a`. Even if you automate the construction of
the circuits a function of :math:`a`, you would still have to run them through
a quantum compilation procedure prior to execution, which would take a
substantial amount of time!

This is where Catalyst comes in. With Catalyst, we can apply just-in-compilation
to the construction and optimization of these circuits. Moreover, we can
do so within the larger context of the rest of the algorithm, including all the
classical control flow around it!
